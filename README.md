  Show how GitHub commits referencing Jira issue keys appear in Jira.
- **Agile Workflow Example:**  
  Illustrate a simple agile process where development work is tracked in Jira and code is maintained in GitHub.
- **Learning Tool:**  
  Serve as a learning resource for managing projects and issues using both GitHub and Jira.
